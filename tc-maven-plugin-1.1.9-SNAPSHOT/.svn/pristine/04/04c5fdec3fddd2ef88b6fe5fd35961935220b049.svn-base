Maven Plugin for Terracotta

 The Maven Plugin for Terracotta provides tight integration between 
 {{{http://terracotta.org/}Terracotta DSO}} and Maven. It makes it really 
 easy to run and test applications with Terracotta. 

 For example, using the Maven Plugin, your project can define the main
 class to launch, and using a simple maven command, can easily 
 launch all of the required Java VMs including the  Terracotta Server 
 to run and test your clustered project.

 To get started with the Terracotta Maven Plugin, review the Goals listed below, 
 then, review the Configuration page to see how to configure your project pom.xml
 file to use the Terracotta Maven Plugin.

 After you have configured your project to use the Terracotta Maven Plugin,
 you can easily launch it using one of the goals listed below, for example 
 to run your project, use the tc:run goal:

+-----+
$ mvn clean tc:run
+-----+

 After that, you can inspect your application by launching the Terracotta
 Admin Console:
 
+-----+
$ mvn tc:admin
+-----+
 
* Goals Overview

  The Maven Plugin for Terracotta provides several goals:

  * {{{bootjar-mojo.html}tc:bootjar}} Build bootjar
  
  * {{{start-mojo.html}tc:start}} Start DSO server
  
  * {{{stop-mojo.html}tc:stop}} Stop DSO server
  
  * {{{restart-mojo.html}tc:restart}} Restart DSO server
  
  * {{{admin-mojo.html}tc:admin}} Start DSO administration UI
  
  * {{{run-mojo.html}tc:run}} Run multiple DSO-enabled processes (it also builds a boot jar, 
    starts the DSO server before running these processes and stops it after they complete)
      
  * {{{clean-mojo.html}tc:clean}} Clean DSO data and logs folders
  
  * {{{terminate-mojo.html}tc:terminate}} Stops DSO-enabled 
    {{{cargo.html}web servers}}} started with {{{run-mojo.html}tc:run}} 
     (these processes don't finish on their own and need to be brought down)
      
  * {{{run-integration-mojo.html}tc:run-integration}} Same as {{{run-mojo.html}tc:run}}, 
    but don't start DSO server and don't wait for when started processes complete 
    (convenient for the {{{cargo.html#Using_Cargo_integration_with_integration_tests}integration testing}})
      
  * {{{terminate-integration-mojo.html}tc:terminate-integration}} Same as 
    {{{terminate-mojo.html}tc:terminate}} but also stops DSO server 
    (convenient for the {{{cargo.html#Using_Cargo_integration_with_integration_tests}integration testing}})
      
  * {{{test-mojo.html}tc:test}} - Runs Surefire/JUnit {{{surefire.html}tests}} 
    in multiple DSO-enabled processes (similar to {{{run-mojo.html}tc:run}}), 
    it also synchronizes these tests automatically

  * {{{manifest-mojo.html}tc:manifest}} - Generates Manifest for 
    {{{http://www.terracotta.org/confluence/display/integrations/Terracotta+Integration+Module+Manual}Terracotta Integration Module}} (TIM)
